# Day 1: Medical Data Ethics & Exploration

## Technical Accomplishments:
- Loaded and explored heart disease dataset (303 patients, 14 medical features)
- Decoded medical data encoding: sex(1=male/0=female), target(heart disease 0/1)
- Performed initial data analysis and statistical overview
- Established project foundation on Kaggle platform

## Key Learnings:
- Real medical data is de-identified for patient privacy protection
- Healthcare AI requires ethical data handling practices
- Numerical encoding standardizes the medical analysis
- Clinical features: age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain types , 
  
## Professional Insight:
"Medical AI begins where patient privacy is protected, de-identified data reveals health patterns while respecting individual dignityy."

## Next Steps:
Day 2: Feature engineering and medical risk score development
