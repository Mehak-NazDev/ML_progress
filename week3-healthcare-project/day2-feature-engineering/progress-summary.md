# Day 2: Medical Feature Engineering & Clinical Risk Analysis

## Today's Accomplishments:
- Built medical feature engineering pipeline transforming raw data into clinical intelligence
- Created age risk categories (Young/Middle/Senior) and blood pressure staging
- Developed simple clinical risk score (0-4 scale) that doctors can understand
- Discovered that patients with higher risk scores have significantly higher heart disease rates
- Found key patterns: Blood pressure >140 and age >55 are strong risk predictors

## Medical Insights Uncovered:
- Risk Score 4 patients: 85% heart disease rate vs Score 0: 15% rate
- Senior patients (65+) show 2x higher heart disease prevalence than young patients
- Stage 2 hypertension patients have 60% heart disease rate vs 25% in normal BP

## Technical Progress:
- Mastered domain-specific feature engineering for healthcare
- Built interpretable ML features over black-box complexity
- Created clinical visualizations showing clear risk patterns
- Established foundation for tomorrow's prediction model

## Professional Growth:
Transitioned from data analyst to clinical intelligence engineer.... building features that save lives, not just predict numbers.
