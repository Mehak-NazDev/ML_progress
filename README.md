# My 90-Day Machine Learning Journey

This repository tracks my journey learning Machine Learning from scratch through small, practical projects and daily progress logs , focused on real-world applications in healthcare and education technology.

Progress Timeline

Week 1: Earned Kaggle Machine Learning Certificate  
Week 2: Earned Pandas Certificate while managing exams, showed up consistently  
Week 3: Built my first healthcare AI project-Heart disease risk scanner
       - shows learning, ethical awareness
       - Achieved 82% accuracy but detected biasness | learned How system actually works
       - Noticed the limitations of my project 
On my way to dive deeper into field technically and improving myself....
Week 4:      
       
       


Current Focus

- Python & Pandas mastery
- Machine Learning fundamentals  
- Preparing for healthcare/education projects
- Building consistent learning habits
- learning about visualization (matplotlib/seaborn)
