# ML Progress
## 90-Day Machine Learning Journey

This repository tracks my journey learning Machine Learning from scratch through small daily progress logs.
It captures my raw learning process...including confusion and mistakes.


### Week 1

* Introduction to Machine Learning
* Earned Kaggle Machine Learning Certificate

### Week 2

* Completed Pandas Certificate while managing exams
* Maintained consistent practice

### Week 3

* Built first healthcare AI project: Heart Disease Risk Scanner

  * Learned ethical considerations and limitations of ML systems
  * Achieved 82% accuracy; identified bias in data

### Week 5

* Strengthened foundations with two ML certificates (theory-heavy)
* Noted: “How do professionals manage all this?...and the learning continues

### Weeks 6-7

* Completed EdTech project for hands-on application
* I also noted many questions after this....let me find the answers 

## Current Focus

* Python & Pandas mastery
