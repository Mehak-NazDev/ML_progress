# Week 6
 Deciding a project smaall but meaningful 
Another week into ml, finally I decided a mini project (student performance predictor) 
currently, working on this project 

Extending the week 6 not because I couldnot make it but because I am working on modeling and I am going to make a dashboard for the predictor
sounds good 
# Steps I did:
1. loaded the data and explored it
2. cleaned the data (missing values and duplicates) and visualize it
3. correlation and heat map
4. learned about the one hot encoding to convert text(Yes/no) to (0/1) feature
5. handled the outliers(extreme values)
6. feature scaling(transfromed fatures to make them suitable for a linear model)
7. Modeling(Used two models : linear regression ,random forest )
8. comparing the models, adding a new model
9. Compared the model, linear regression performed the best
10. Found many critical bugs in the notebook(a hectic and selfdoubting phase, yet I will not give up)
11. I will try to solve bugs and then deploy the model  
12. Stuck with dashboard making
13. Finally successfully deployed the model and completed the project

#  Notable points
1. Wrong scaling can cause data leakage
2. scale only the training data and for LR model ..the tree based models dont require scaling
3. choose right question for the right problem
4. High R2 is not always a bug
5. Understand the data and problem fisrt
6. find correlation so it will help you to model better

# Futrure improvements 
1. Add more features like social media influence or addiction, parental involvement
2. Deploy it live using streamlit
3. Make dashboard interactive because the previous one has a color mismatch problem
