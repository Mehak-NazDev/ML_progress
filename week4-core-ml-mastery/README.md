This week focuses on strengthning the fundamentals of machine learning  & building the key concepts from scratch.


# Focus Areas

-Manual data analysis and validation

-Statistical testing and interpretation

-Implementing algorithms (Logistic Regression) & learn 2 new model from scratch

-Implementing the new models

-Rigorous model evaluation and fairness checks

-End-to-end reproducible workflow


# Objective
Build the technical confidence to explain, defend, and implement core ML concepts independently

Trying to balance the academics and ml together, a little overwhelmed but I'll start again tommorow(day 1)
# results
I could not meet my objective but I studied the data manipulation and tried to handle messier data insted of doing work on Ml
